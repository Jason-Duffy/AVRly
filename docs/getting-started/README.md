The projects outlined in this repository are intended for "bare metal" AVR programming. That is - compiling, debugging and flashing your application to the target MCU using the AVR crosspack 2 toolchain and an ISP programmer, rather than using the simpler and more user-friendly Arduino framework.

# Requirements:

## A Source Code Editor
I like [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL], but there are plenty of others to choose from, some popular choices are:
- [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL]
- [Visual Studio Code][VS_Code_URL]
- [Codespaces][Codespaces_URL]
- [Atom][Atom_URL]

## The AVR Toolchain
### MacOS
[AVR CrossPack][AVR_Crosspack_URL] Will provide everything you need to develop for AVR on MacOS; the GNU compile suite, C libraries for the AVR, the AVRDUDE uploader and more.
### Linux
#### Debian/Ubuntu distributions
- Its helpful to update all your current installed packages first.

	`sudo apt-get update`

	`sudo apt-get upgrade all`

- Then we can install the required packages.

	`sudo apt-get install avrdude avrdude-doc gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc gdb-avr`

#### Red Hat and Fedora distributions
- Its helpful to update all your current installed packages first.

	`sudo yum update`

	`sudo yum upgrade-all`

- Then we can install the required packages.

	`sudo yum install avrdude avr-gcc avr-binutils avr-libc avr-gdb`

### Windows
Windows users can use the official toolchain from the manufacturer, [Microchip Studio][Microchip_Studio_URL]. This is an IDE so it's full of features, but also has steep learning curve - follow their tutorial [here][Microchip_Studio_Tutorial_URL] to get to grips with it.
## A Serial Terminal Program
This is used to send messages between your PC and the target MCU, and you'll find it's a vital debugging tool when coupled with the log_system module. I tend to use [CoolTerm][CoolTerm_URL] which is available on MacOS, Windows and Linux.


# Hardware Required:

## An AVR microcontroller


## An ISP Programmer
Such as an [AVRISP MKII][AVRISP_URL], however I had some compatability issues with this one (on MacOS) so instead I just use an Arduino Uno with the "Arduino as ISP" sketch flashed to it, and a simple shield I made - though you can achieve the same thing with just some dupont cables if you don't want to wait for the shield to come back from fab.

## A USB to Serial Converter
There are many of these available, I use one of [these][USB_Serial_URL]

## Various USB cables
It's useful to keep several USB cables, micro, mini, USB-A etc

## Breadboards
I like [these][Small_Breadboard_URL] ones with the power supply module for small test projects, and [these][Large_Breadboard_URL] ones for larger, more complex projects. For anything beyond that, I would design a development board with lots of connection and expansion flexibility.
