The projects outlined in this repository are intended for "bare metal" AVR programming. That is - compiling, debugging and flashing your application to the target MCU using the AVR crosspack 2 toolchain and an ISP programmer, rather than using the simpler and more user-friendly Arduino framework.

# Requirements:

## A Source Code Editor
I like [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL], but there are plenty of others to choose from, some popular choices are:
- [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL]
- [Visual Studio Code][VS_Code_URL]
- [Codespaces][Codespaces_URL]
- [Atom][Atom_URL]

## The AVR toolchain
### MacOS
[AVR CrossPack][AVR_Crosspack_URL] Will provide everything you need to develop for AVR on MacOS; the GNU compile suite, C libraries for the AVR, the AVRDUDE uploader and more.
### Linux
#### Debian/Ubuntu distributions
- Its helpful to update all your current installed packages first.

	`sudo apt-get update`

	`sudo apt-get upgrade all`

- Then we can install the required packages.

	`sudo apt-get install avrdude avrdude-doc gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc gdb-avr`
#### Red Hat and Fedora distributions
- Its helpful to update all your current installed packages first.
	`sudo yum update`

	`sudo yum upgrade-all`

- Then we can install the required packages.

	`sudo yum install avrdude avr-gcc avr-binutils avr-libc avr-gdb`
### Windows
Windows users can use the official toolchain from the manufacturer, [Microchip Studio][Microchip_Studio_URL]. This is an IDE so it's full of features, but also has steep learning curve - follow their tutorial [here][Microchip_Studio_Tutorial_URL] to get to grips with it. 
## An ISP programmer
Such as an AVRISP MKII, however I just use an Arduino Uno with the "Arduino as ISP" sketch flashed to it, and a simple shield I made. (Though you can achieve the same thing with just some dupont cables).
## A serial terminal program
For debugging, I tend to use CoolTerm for MacOS.
