The projects outlined in this repository are intended for "bare metal" AVR programming. That is - compiling, debugging and flashing your application to the target MCU using the AVR crosspack 2 toolchain and an ISP programmer, rather than using the simpler and more user-friendly Arduino framework.

Requirements:

- A source code editor (I like [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL], but there are plenty of others to choose from, some popular choices are:
	- [Sublime Text][Sublime_Text_URL]
	- [Visual Studio Code][VS_Code_URL]
	- [Codespaces][Codespaces_URL]
	- [Atom][Atom_URL]
- The AVR toolchain
	- MacOS
	[AVR CrossPack][AVR_Crosspack_URL] Will provide everything you need to develop for AVR on MacOS; the GNU compile suite, C libraries for the AVR, the AVRDUDE uploader and more. 
- An ISP programmer such as an AVRISP MKII, however I just use an Arduino Uno with the "Arduino as ISP" sketch flashed to it, and a simple shield I made. (Though you can achieve the same thing with just some dupont cables).
- A serial terminal program for debugging, I tend to use CoolTerm for MacOS.
