 * @brief Driver for USART0 communication on the AtMega2560
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * 
 * This file provides basic functionality to communicate between an AVR and a
 * PC via USART0 and a USB to UART adapter. The current porting is for an
 * AtMega2560, but I may port it to others at a later date. This driver was
 * adapted from the book Make: AVR Programming by Elliot Williams, and his git
 * repo which can be found at the link below.
 * @see https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming
