AVRly was created to provide a framework for embedded firmware development with AVR microcontrollers. It's aimed at hobbyists from a beginner to intermediate level looking to get started with AVR's or give their existing projects a professional edge, and is perfect for Arduino users looking to take the next step.

AVRly provides guides for setting up and testing your development environment, file structure, documentation, style and layout. The platform also provides drivers and example projects written in the C programming language, for interfacing with a variety of components including sensors, displays, SOC's, debugging tools and more.
