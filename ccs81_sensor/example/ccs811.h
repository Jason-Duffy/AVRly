/**
 * @file ccs811.h
 * @author Jason Duffy
 * @date 4th March 2022
 * @brief Driver for the CCS81 .
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * 
 * This file provides the basic low-level functionality for the CCS81 gas
 * sensor / air quality sensor. It was tested with the CJMCU-811 module which
 * provides pin breakout to THT for breadboard prototyping, and some peripheral
 * circuitry. The CCS811 eatures an on-board MCU to interface with, greatly
 * reducing the load on the host MCU. 
 * 
 * When the sensor is new, a burn-in period of 48hr is necessary for the
 * resistive elements to level out and make readings more accurate. The CCS81
 * controls the burn-in period, allowing eCO2 and eTVOC readings to be used
 * from first power-on after 60 minutes of operation in modes 1-3.
 * 
 * After early-life (Burn-In) use the conditioning period is the time required
 * to achieve good sensor stability before measuring VOCs after a long idle
 * period. After starting the application and calling init_ccs811(), run the
 * sensor for 20 minutes before accurate readings are generated. The
 * conditioning period must also be observed before writing to the BASELINE
 * register.
 * 
 * This driver was written using the datasheet for the ams CCS81 gas sensor,
 * which can be found at the link below.
 * @see
