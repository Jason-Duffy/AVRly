# C Libraries for AVR

@mainpage LCD Example.

@author Jason Duffy.

This example is intended to give you an idea how the hd44780_lcd driver can be implemented on an AVR. The current porting is for an ATmega2560 with a 16MHz external oscillator. 

AVR Crosspack 2 installation is required, and will provide you with the necessary toolchain and header files.
