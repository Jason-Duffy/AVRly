## Introduction

The Hitachi HD44780 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) controller is an extremely popular IC (Integrated Circuit) in use since the 1980's. It can drive upto two lines of 8 characters each, and can be addressed using either an 8 bit of 4 bit parallel data bus, plus some control pins. This driver and example application was written from the datasheet, which can be found [here][HD44780_Datasheet_URL].

This example is for a 16x2 LCD module, with the HD44780 LCD controller IC on board. 


## Interface

For this example, we will use the controller in 4 bit mode, it uses fewer precious GPIO's, but takes twice as long for each character or instruction to be written to the display. The connections required are shown below. 

| Pin      | Function            |
| -------- | -------------       |
| VSS	   | Ground Connection   |
| VDD      | +5V Connection      |
| VE       | Contrast Adjust     |
| RS       | Register Select     |
| RW       | Read/Write Select   |
| E        | Enable (Latch)      |
| D4       | Data Pin 4          |
| D5       | Data Pin 5          |
| D6       | Data Pin 6          |
| D7       | Data Pin 7          |
| A        | Backlight+ (Annode) |
| K        | Backlight- (Cathode)|
