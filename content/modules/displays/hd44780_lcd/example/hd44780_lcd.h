 * @author Jason Duffy
 * @date 1st March 2022
 * @brief Driver for the HD44780 based 16x2 liquid crystal display.
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * 
 * This file provides the basic low-level functionality for the ubiquitous 16x2
 * display. Please note that it uses long blocking waits in the initialisation
 * routine (100ms), and short blocking waits in other utility functions
 * (2uS - 2mS). This was done to simplify the code as the busy flag read
 * introduced pitfalls. This driver currently only allows for a single display
 * to be used, but this might be improved on at a later date.
 * 
 * This driver was written using the datasheet for the HITACHI HD44780U LCD
 * driver chip, which can be found at the link below.
 * @see http://www.datasheet-pdf.com/PDF/HD44780U-Datasheet-Hitachi-1109874
