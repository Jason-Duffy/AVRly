 * @date 1st March 2022
 * @brief Definitions for pin mapping (for hd44780_lcd)
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * 
 * This file provides definitions for pin/port references used in the hd44780
 * driver. If you are using it in 8 bit mode, you need to wire all 8 data pins
 * D0 - D7 to pins Px0 - Px7 of a single port, and define that port as
 * LCD_DATA_PORT. You do not need to define LCD_D0 - LCD_D3 in this file though
 * as they are not referred to by pin in the code, only by whole port. 
 * 
 * If you are using the display in 4 bit mode, you can wire the 4 data pins
 * D4 - D7 to any 4 pins on the port you defined as LCD_DATA_PORT, just make
 * sure they are in the correct order (you cannot wire them as D7, D5, D6, D4
 * for instance). The LCD_CTRL_PORT can either be a separate port, or it can
 * be on the same port as the data pins (this only applies in 4 bit mode). 
 * 
 * If you'd like to expand this project, you need to keep just one
 * pin_defines.h file per project. All pins and ports can be defined here, then
 * just #include "pin_defines.h" in any file that uses these definitions.
 * Remember to prefix your pin/port names with the name of the module or device
 * they belong to.
