 * @brief Driver for the MCP4812 10 bit DAC (digital to analog converter) chip.
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * @details This file provides the basic low-level functionality for the
 * MCP4812 10 bit DAC from Microchip. This driver currently only allows for a
 * single DAC to be used, but this might be improved on at a later date. This
 * driver was written using the datasheet for the Microchip MCP4812 chip, which
 * can be found at the link below.
 * @see https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20002249B.pdf
