@ingroup mcp48x2

## Introduction
The MCP48x2 series from Microchip are dual buffered output [Digital to Analog converters][DAC_URL] available in 8 bit, 10 bit and 12 bit resolutions. These devices operate from a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply and an [SPI][SPI_URL] interface, and can be used for sensor calibration, hardware self-testing, op-amp control, programmable voltage reference and  more.

This module was tested on an MCP4812 10 bit DAC, but should also work with the other models if configured correctly. The datasheet for all 3 devices can be found [here][MCP48x2_Datasheet_URL].

The host MCU sends data to the DAC using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol. For a quick guide on SPI communication, take a look at the module [here][SPI_Module_URL].

## Pinout

![MCP48x2 Pinout](./images/mcp48x2_pinout.png)

| Pin       | Function  |
| --------- | --------- |
| (1) VDD   | Positive supply pin, 2.7V to 5.5V |
| (2) CS    | Chip Select pin, device is selected when this is pulled low |
| (3) SCK   | Serial Clock signal from host MCU |
| (4) SDI   | Serial Data Input pin - same as MOSI |
| (5) LDAC  | Latch pin, to control when outputs are updated with new values. Pull low to latch new values into outputs |
| (6) VoutB  | Output pin for Channel B |
| (7) Vss    | Ground connection |
| (8) VoutA  | Output pin for Channel A |

## Hookup

![MCP48x2 Hookup](./images/mcp48x2_hookup.png)

| Pin       | Connection   |
| --------- | ------------ |
| (1) VDD   | +5V Supply. Decoupling caps are recommended but optional |
| (2) CS    | Connect to PB2 |
| (3) SCK   | Connect to PB5 |
| (4) SDI   | Connect to PB3 |
| (5) LDAC  | Optional, if latching of output is desired, connect to PB1. If not required, tie to GND |
| (6) VoutB | Multimeter 1 test probe |
| (7) Vss   | Ground |
| (8) VoutA | Multimeter 2 test probe |

Note that there is no connection to the host MCU MISO pin, as this device is write only - the data only goes in one direction, from the MCU to the DAC.

## API Reference

Before initialising the DAC for use, you'll need to instantiate a dac_config_t object, and set the configuration values you'd like.

```C
dac_config_t dac_config =
{
	.model = mcp4812,
	.sync_manually = false,

	.channel_a.gain_low = false,
	.channel_a.active = true,
	.channel_a.level = 0,

	.channel_b.gain_low = false,
	.channel_b.active = true,
	.channel_b.level = 0,
};
```
### Members
- model: Valid selections are mcp4802, mcp4812 or mcp4822.
- sync_manually: true = manual sync, false = sync automatically.
