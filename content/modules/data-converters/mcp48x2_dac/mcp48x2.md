# MCP48x2 Dual Channel DAC

## Introduction
The MCP48x2 series from Microchip are dual buffered output [Digital to Analog converters][DAC_URL] available in 8 bit, 10 bit and 12 bit resolutions. These devices operate from a single 2.7V to 5.5V supply and an [SPI][SPI_URL] interface, and can be used for sensor calibration, hardware self-testing, op-amp control, programmable voltage reference and  more.

This module was tested on an MCP4812 10 bit DAC, but should also work with the other models if configured correctly.
