## Introduction

USART is a form of serial communication protocol, and stands for Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)Transmitter. This protocal provides the option of synchronous or asynchronous modes (meaning with or without a clock signal line).

You may also see the term UART around (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) which refers to a system which only has the option of an agreed baud rate. The system featured in AVR microcontrollers is USART, however we will be using it in it's asynchronous mode here.
