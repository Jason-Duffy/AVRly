## Introduction

I<sup>2</sup>C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), also known as I2C, IIC, or TWI (Two Wire Interface) is a Syncronous, packet-switched serial communications bus protocol designed for short distance intra-board communication. It's often favoured over SPI communication where there are many devices on the bus and not enough GPIO lines to have a CS line for each, as I<sup>2</sup>C uses a 7 bit address to select a device.
