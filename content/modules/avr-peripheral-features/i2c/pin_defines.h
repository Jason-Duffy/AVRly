 * @brief Definitions for pin mapping.
 * @bug No known bugs. 
 * 
 * If you'd like to expand this project, you need to keep just one
 * pin_defines.h file per project. All pins and ports can be defined here, then
 * just #include "pin_defines.h" in any file that uses these definitions.
 * Remember to prefix your pin/port names with the name of the module or device
 * they belong to.
