# ATmega Dev Kit

Things can get messy pretty quickly when working with a microcontroller in a breadboard, so I've designed a dev kit to make things a little simpler. It's a bit like the Arduino Uno, except it doesn't abstract away what I believe to be crucial aspects of working with microcontrollers.

Features:

- A USART port is exposed for logging, via a USB/Serial adapter.
- Clearly labelled GPIO's, arranged in octal ports with 2 sockets per pin. 
- External 16MHz oscillator (optional - means trading for GPIO's).
- 1A 3.3V and 1A 5V supply.
- DC jack (9V).
- Reset button.
- ISP programming port (6 pin IDC socket).
- Separate ISP programmer (Arduino UNO with custom shield).
- Programmer is compatible with Windows, MacOS, or Linux host machines.
- Interchangeable breadboard, so you can swap between projects.


I'll supply the schematics and BOM for you to build these yourself, but if you'd rather not, they can be purchased on my eBay store (coming soon).
