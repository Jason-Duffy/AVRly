# Contributor's Guide

Contibutions to AVRly are more than welcome!

If you feel you could improve on a module in this collection, or add new modules for other components users might like to see, it would be great to have you involved! Contributors will be credited on the site and in Copyright notices in each file they worked on. Some examples of modules which other users may find useful are:

- Drivers for AVR peripheral features (interrupts, timers, ADC etc).
- Drivers to interface with sensors.
- Display drivers.
- User input drivers (buttons, encoders, touchpads etc).
- Whole projects implementing several other modules. These will need to be documented carefully with their own guides in .md files, and Kicad schematics and files for any hardware needed. 

## Style Guide
For a comprehensive guide on layout, style and documentation, see the [Anatomy of Embedded Firmware][Firmware_Anatomy_URL] page. For even more detail on this, see the [Barr Group C Coding Standard][Barr_Coding_Standard_URL]. Modularity and compartmentalisation are key for ease of maintainance and code re-use, just because this isn't C++ doesn't mean we have to throw away all those object oriented principles! If you want to extend a module in this collection to provide an extra layer of functionality for a specific purpose, the [facade pattern][Facade_Wiki_URL] should be used. For an example on this, see the [log system module][Log_System_URL] and observe how the USART driver is implemented, hiding it's inner workings from the layer above. 

## Templates
The [Github repository][Github_Repo_URL] contains [templates for each file type][Templates_URL] mentioned in the [Anatomy of Embedded Firmware][Firmware_Anatomy_URL] guide. These templates will provide the bare-bones file structure for your project, along with a Makefile to assist with building and compiling your application. 

## What to Avoid
Try to keep drivers and modules concise. Each driver should perform a specific set of tasks well, and should expose the least possible data from within the source code. To share data between files, queues and/or getter and setter functions should be used to return data, rather than using `extern` variables in the header file (where possible).

Avoid using bulky standard library functions as these can link in alot of unwanted code. Instead, it's sometimes better to provide your own stripped back implementation of these functions. That doesn't mean don't use the standard library of course, just have some awareness of the overhead of external code. You can see the code size of the compiled binary by running `make size`, and you can get an idea of what the linker script is doing by running `make disassemble`, which will generate a .lst file containing an approximate assembly version of the code.

## Bugs
Known bugs in your own work should be documented in the Doxygen special comment block at the top of the file, using the `@bug` command. Ideally, don't submit work with known bugs, but if it's minor, the module generally works well and you feel you need other contributors to help you solve the issue, thats what `@bug` is there for. Opening and solving "Issues" on the Github repo is also encouraged where necessary. 

## Development Process
My personal preference for managing the Git workflow is [Github Desktop][Github_Desktop_URL] as I think it provides the most clarity, but some users may prefer to use Git in the command line. The steps described below are for Github Desktop. I'll outline the basics here, but for an in-depth guide on the git workflow, see their documentation [here][Github_Desktop_Docs_URL].

### Cloning/Forking the Repository
In the **File** menu, go to **Clone Repository**, then select the **URL** tab. In the **URL** field, paste in the following: https://github.com/Jason-Duffy/AVRly

In the **Local Path** field, select the location you'd like your local repo to be stored. Ensure the last directory in the path is empty. If the location you want has files in already, you can just create a new subdirectory by adding the new folder name on the end of the path. Then click **Clone**.

As you will not have write access to this repository, Github will create a fork, and will ask you how you plan to use it. Select **To contribute to the parent project** if you plan on doing so, otherwise select **For my own purposes**, then click **Continue**.

### Workflow
Use the **development** branch while working on your code, try to make regular commits with a message briefly explaining the changes you have made. This is valuable for yourself and others to see what has been done, when and why.
