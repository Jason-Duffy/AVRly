AVRly was created to provide a framework for embedded firmware development with AVR microcontrollers. It's aimed at hobbyists from beginner to intermediate level looking to get started with AVR's or give their existing projects a professional edge, and is perfect for Arduino users looking to take the next step.

This platform provides documented drivers and example projects written in the C programming language, along with Kicad files and schematics for interfacing with a variety of components including sensors, displays, SOC's, debugging tools and more. It also provides guides for setting up and testing your development environment, style, layout, file structure and documentation.
