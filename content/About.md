AVRly (ae-ver-li) was created to provide a framework for embedded firmware development with AVR microcontrollers. It's aimed at hobbyists from beginner to intermediate level looking to get started with AVR's or give their existing projects a professional edge, and is perfect for Arduino users looking to take the next step.

This platform provides documented drivers and example projects written in the C programming language, along with Kicad files and schematics for interfacing with a variety of components including sensors, displays, SOC's, debugging tools and more. It also provides guides for setting up and testing your development environment, style, layout, file structure and documentation. This is not, however, a C programming tutorial - some kowledge of basic C programming and electronics is assumed.   

Due to the constraints often present with embedded systems, the drivers in this collection are designed to be lightweight, without dependance on standard library functions such as printf(), and thus avoiding linking in bulky sections of code.
