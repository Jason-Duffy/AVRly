## A Word on Doxygen
Throughout this repository, the code has been documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). It's an easy way to generate documentation which stays close to the code so it's not too difficult to keep the two in line. The html for this site was also generated using Doxygen.

The licence and copyright notice are enclosed in a Javadoc style banner, which Doxygen will recognise as a banner comment. To use this stye of banner, `JAVADOC_BANNER = YES` must be set in the Doxyfile. Add your name in the copyright notice. 


### C Header File
A C header file should be named after the function of the file or the peripheral that it serves, and the file extension is `.h`. The filename should be entirely in lowercase. An example file can be found in the repo [here][Header_File_Example_URL], and the Doxygen output from these special comments and commands can be found [here][Header_File_Doxygen_Output_URL]. 

After the license, place a Javadoc style comment block with some special Doxygen commands: `@file`, `@author`, `@date`, `@brief`, `@bug` and `@see`.

```C
/**
 * @file filename.h
 * @author Your Name Here.
 * @date 15th March 2022
 * @brief The brief description goes here. After the first full stop, this text
 * becomes the detailed description. Add an explanation of the purpose and
 * limitations of the module, along with any other notes that may be useful to
 * others using it. In the Doxyfile, ensure JAVADOC_BANNER = YES, and
 * JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES, to use this style of commenting. 
 * @bug Known bugs are declared and described here.
 * @see "See also" links go here https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html
 */
```

The doxygen output from these special comments looks like this:

 Next come the include guards - a preprocessor mechanism used to prevent the header file contents being included in other files multiple times. 

```C
#ifndef FILENAME_DOT_H
#define FILENAME_DOT_H

// Contents of header file go here. 

#endif // FILENAME_DOT_H
```

`#include` directives come next, with standard library headers listed first, then the local, project specific headers. 

```C
// Header file needed for fixed width integer types. 
#include <stdint.h>
```

Typedefs, enums etc come next, along with any macro definitions. 

Function prototypes/declarations are now listed, with the initialisation function first. 

```C
/*
 * Public initialisation function declaration comes first.
 */
void init_object(uint16_t value);


/*
 * Other public function declarations come afterwards.
 */
uint16_t get_value(void);
```

The file ends with closure of the header guards, two blank lines and an `/*** end of file ***/` comment followed by a blank line. 

```C
// End of include guard.
#endif // FILENAME_DOT_H


/*** end of file ***/

```
